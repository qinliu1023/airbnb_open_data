# airbnb_open_data


## Installation
This notebook should be ok to run with python 3 through Anocaonda.


## Motivation
With these open data, I am interested in understanding how Airbnb listings' features, reviews, and prices would differ across time and city. Using these data, I mainly explored on:
1. Listings availability and price
1. Listings Reviews
1. Listings Price prediction


## File Descriptions
There are two zip files containing the data downloaded from Kaggle. And one notebook containing the analysis of the data.


## Results
Summaries are provided at the end of each session.
